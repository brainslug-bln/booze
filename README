DEVELOPING BOOZE
There is a project page on github where you can access the 
latest source code. Please feel free to participate:
https://github.com/booze.
Take a look at the Booze website for information about 
developing Booze: http://booze.esnake.de.

RUNNING BOOZE
First of all, you need a Java Runtime Environment. Fetch it from 
http://www.java.com/download/ or install it via your package 
manager.
The software itself is based on the Grails framework. Therefore you need
to install Grails before you can run Booze. 
Download it from http://grails.org/ and follow the installation 
instructions. You need to have grails/bin in your PATH to issue
the following commands. Test it by executing "grails" from your command
line.
Once you got Grails running, run Booze by issuing "grails run-app"
in the command line. This will start the application in development
mode, listening on http://localhost:8080/Booze/. You can switch to 
production mode by adding a "prod" before the run-app: "grails prod run-app".
There will be far less debugging output in production mode. Please 
consider that Booze uses different database files for production and
development mode (./devDb vs. ./db/booze.db).

BOOZE APPLICATION STARTER
For convenience I developed a little Java application which fires up
a Jetty application server and deploys Booze automatically. 
After startup, you can access Booze by pointing your browser to 
http://localhost:8098/. 

BUILDING BOOZE
You can build a .war file for deployment in your favorite application 
server by executing "grails war" from within the application directory.
If you want to use the Booze Application Starter, place "booze.war" in  
the "backend" folder. 
The "build.sh" script automatically builds booze and copies all needed
files including the application starter into the ./dist directory.
You can run the application from there by executing "java -jar booze.jar".

Have fun!
